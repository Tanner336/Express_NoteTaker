# Express_NoteTaker

## Description
This is a note taking application using express that will take in a title and body of notes save them in a the form of a JSON.
It allows you to delete and add new notes.

## Installation
You will need to install the package.json

## Problems
No matter what I did or where I tried to look up the answer I could not find out how to deploy my app on Heroku, I spent hours following the errors and implementing solutions that ultimately failed. 
I have attached a screenshot of my error message in the repo. Hopefully someone can help me. as well as the url for my heroku https://agile-crag-06097.herokuapp.com/
The application and all of the code works perfectly on my local drive. It saves the information taken in and adds it to the db.json file as well as deletes it when hyou hit the trash can button, but I could not get it to deploy on Heroku despite my best efforts.
I was told in the course that it is better to turn in something rather than nothing and I hope you will be lenient on the grading considering the actual codebase functions and the only thing missing is the heroku deployment.

## Contributing 
If you wish to contribute, please leave the app better than when you found it.

## Request
In your reveiw of my assignment, please try and help with my heroku deployment issue as I was pulling my hair out trying to solve it and I will take whatever grade you give.
